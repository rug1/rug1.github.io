At the time I felt angry, humiliated and lost, but being fired from a job that I knew wasn't right for me turned out to be a blessing in disguise. It inevitably led me to find a career in software engineering. As we start the New Year, 2023, I thought it apt to reflect on my career journey from the beginning.</p>\n<h2>The estate agent</h2>\n<p>In 2014, I worked at the front desk for a London estate agency. As a naive 21 year old who had just graduated from university, I thought working at an estate agency would be “fun”. I quickly found out the environment wasn’t for me. My job at the front desk was slow and cumbersome, I used to challenge myself to see how <em>slowly</em> I could do all my tasks for the day and every time I would finish them before lunchtime. For the rest of the day I had to “look busy” otherwise I was questioned by my managers. I was on £19k, which barely equated to a standard London living wage at the time, and I genuinely thought I would never reach £30k before the age of 30!</p>\n<p>Nine months later I landed a job as a lettings negotiator. I was super excited to start my new job, be in a new environment, and show people around houses - as a bonus I thought I could get a few ideas for how I could decorate my own house one day. However, my dreams were quickly shattered. A mere three weeks into the job, the lettings regional manager called me aside and fired me. I was shocked, I didn’t know what to say. I asked for the reasoning behind this decision and if there was anything I could do, but they said they didn’t need to give me a reason and I had to leave immediately. At first I cried, but after two minutes I wasn’t upset anymore, I was angry. I thought, “how can they treat people like this?!”. I was hitting all my set targets and engaging in the business as a new starter, so to this day I’m still not quite sure why I was fired. I’m certain there would have been a case for unfair or wrongful dismissal but that’s a story for another day.</p>\n<h2>The introvert</h2>\n<p>The situation gave me the time to think about who I am and what I wanted to be in life. It took me a long time to feel comfortable with my introverted personality, society led me to believe it was a bad thing to initially be shy and reserved - traits prevalent in the estate agency industry certainly led me to believe this were true. It was hard to push myself to speak up at first, but as time went on I learnt how to use my introverted personality to my advantage and see it as a positive part of myself.</p>\n<h2>The junior</h2>\n<p>Now you’re probably thinking, how did I go from an estate agency to software engineering. The answer - I came across an article in the Guardian about a free coding school called Founders &#x26; Coders and realised it could be a possible career option. I contacted them straight away and after about a week I was invited to enrol on their sixth cohort. The three month fullstack JavaScript intensive course was an amazing experience and I met some amazing people along the way who are still in my life today. However, the decision to fully commit to the course was something I had to think about carefully. Living in London is expensive and studying full time means it would be difficult to earn the same level of money that I had previously become accustomed to. So, I left my rented flat share and moved back home. Luckily my parents lived in London which meant I didn’t have to worry about rent, bills or food and importantly I could still attend the course. I’m very grateful I had this option as I know a lot of people aren’t as fortunate. The course gave me some great foundational knowledge of fullstack JavaScript. However, at the time bootcamps were still a fairly new concept and an untraditional route into software engineering, so I felt it wasn’t enough to ensure I felt confident going into interviews for permanent roles. I decided to freelance on smaller projects to gain additional experience and continue learning. This was a turning point, from coding for “fun” to coding for a career.</p>\n<p>After freelancing for almost a year I decided I was confident enough to start interviewing. I applied for a junior frontend developer position at JustGiving and completed my first ever technical interview. I never imagined that I would be offered the job after so little time interviewing in a new industry, so I was thrilled when I got the result! This was what really kick started my career. I knew I needed to be surrounded by people with far more experience than me to take my career to the next level. I felt like I was absorbing so much information, I had to learn fast, but I loved it. There were so many things that I had never had to consider before working as a “professional” software engineer. For example, what it means to write production code, what a design system is, how to properly write tests. To this day, I don’t think I’ve learnt so much in such a small space of time and I give a lot of credit to my team at JustGiving who taught me so much and gave me a great start to my career.</p>\n<h2>The software engineer</h2>\n<p>Now, seven years into my software engineering career, there are two main things that I have learnt about myself and the industry. First, I have fluctuated between frontend and fullstack but frontend technology is what I enjoy the most. The frontend is where I want to focus my career, become a technical expert and eventually become a thought leader. Second, there isn’t enough equal representation in the industry. Software engineering wasn’t something I knew about at school or at university. I feel strongly about ensuring young people and those seeking a career change, especially women and those in underrepresented communities, have the right access to industry knowledge and information about software engineering. I assure I make myself available to those who want a mentor and I like to coach at workshops, all of which are free and promote diversity within the industry. I look forward to having a long career in software engineering and being a voice that contributes to promoting diversity, equity and inclusion within the industry wherever I go.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"January 04, 2023","slug":"/blog/frontdesk-to-frontend","title":"Front desk to Frontend: My journey into software engineering","image":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rug1/rug1.github.io/master-source/src/images/working-profile.jpg","author":null,"canonicalURL":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/frontdesk-to-frontend"}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
