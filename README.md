## Welcome to my personal site

I use this space to experiment with new tech I'm interested in and to write blog posts. All the source code can be found on the branch `master-source` and the deployed complied code can be found on the branch `master`. The live site can be found on my custom domain: https://www.ruth.io/

### What tech am I using?

- Gatsby: I chose to use gatsby for the benefits that come out of the box on page performance and SEO efficiency.
- Styled components
- Github pages
- GraphQL

### What tech do I still want to introduce:

- Typescript
- React testing library
- SEO

### Other tasks to do

- [ ] Rename `master` to `main`
- [ ] Build the experience page
- [ ] Update email subscription and tracking accounts

### How does the blog work?

I write the blog posts in markdown in the [posts](https://github.com/rug1/rug1.github.io/tree/master-source/posts) directory and make use of the templating engine provided by Gatsby. I set up a [template](https://github.com/rug1/rug1.github.io/blob/master-source/src/templates/blogTemplate.js) which Gatsby then uses to generate every post.
